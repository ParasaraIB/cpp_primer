# Exercise 2.26
(a) const int buf;
    It is invalid. const type variable have to be initialized.
(b) int cnt = 0;
    This is valid.
(c) const int sz = cnt;
    This is valid.
(d) ++ cnt; ++sz;
    This isn't valid for sz since increment operation is changing the original
    value of initialized variable.
