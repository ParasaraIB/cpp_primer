# Exercise 2.25
(a) int* ip, i, &r = i;
    &r is reference to int i.
    i is an object defined as int type (default initialization).
    ip is a pointer to int.
(b) int i, *ip = 0;
    ip is a pointer to literal 0.
    i is defined int object with default initialization.
(c) int* ip, ip2;
    ip2 is a defined int object with default initialization.
    ip is a pointer to int.
