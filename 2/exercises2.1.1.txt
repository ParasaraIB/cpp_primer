# Exercise 2.1
* int is used to represent whole numbers. Unsigned type of integer is the value
  greater than or equal to zero, such as: 0, 1, 2, .... Signed type of int
  are all the whole numbers including negatives. Signed means it has a sign
  that consists of two types: positive and negative.
* long is used to represent whole numbers with greater size in terms of memory
  occupied to store the value. int can only store as many as 16 bits of size while
  long is the extended version which can store up to 32 bits integer.
* long long is the extended version of long which can store up 64 bits integer.
* short is almost the same to int in several CPU architectures. However, it is
  guaranteed that short will never be greater than int in terms of memory occupation
  in the system. For high-end architectures, int can store as many as 32 bits numbers
  while short remains 16 bits.
* float and double are used to initialize the data type of numbers with decimal points.
  The difference simply lies between the precision of the decimal point it can represents.
  float has 6 significant digits while double has 10.

# Exercise 2.2
To calculate mortgage payment it is appropriate to initialize:
* long double rate; // it is chosen to accomodate extended-precision needed to represent
  the payment rate since banks state its rate as percentage with double-trailling decimal.
  For example: 10.25%.
* int principal; // The amount that is owed by bank usually in the whole number, such as:
  $5,000,000.
* double payment; // Due to multiplication with rate (to the power of mortgage term) the
  currency standard becomes as specific as its cent. For example: $500,000.25
