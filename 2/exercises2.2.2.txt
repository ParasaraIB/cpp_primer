# Exercise 2.11
(a) extern int ix = 1024;
    This is a declaration with explicit initializer hence it can be called
    as definition. The extern type definition is overrode by the initializer 
    on variable ix so that it becomes defined. If this definition is done
    inside a function than error will occur.
(b) int iy;
    iy is defined as the type of int with default initializers.
(c) extern int iz;
    iz is declared since there is extern definition preceedes the int definition.
